# üßÖ FT_ONION

## üìù Mandatory Part

You must run a web server that shows a webpage on the Tor network.
* The service must have a static web page: a single index.html file. The page will
be accessible through a url of the type xxxxxxxxx.onion. The content displayed
on the page is up to you.
* Nginx will be used to configure the web server. No other server or framework is
allowed.
* Access to the static page via HTTP on port 80 must be enabled.
* Access to the server via SSH on port 4242 must be enabled.
* You should not open any ports or set any firewall rules.

## üíØ Bonus Part

The evaluation of the bonuses will be done IF AND ONLY IF the mandatory part is
PERFECT. Otherwise, the bonuses will be totally IGNORED.
You can enhance your project with the following features:
* SSH fortification. It will be thoroughly tested during evaluation.
* An interactive application, something more impressive than a static webpage.
