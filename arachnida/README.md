You can install the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries using pip.

### 🛠️ Usage
To run Spider, navigate to the directory where the spider.py file is located and run the following command in your terminal:

python spider.py [-h] [-r] [-l DEPTH] [-p PATH] url

The available options are:

* -r: download images recursively from the URL received as a parameter.
* -r -l [N]: indicates the maximum depth level of the recursive download. If not specified, the default level will be 5.
* -p [PATH]: indicates the path where the downloaded files will be saved. If not specified, the default path will be ./data/.
